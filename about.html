            Welcome to the residential area of Krusboda
        </h1>
        <p>
            Krusboda is located high in a hilly forest terrain with a mile-wide view. for children, it is a kingdom of heaven with planned play areas right next to the buildings. Thanks to special garages and parking spaces at a convenient distance from the houses, you can enjoy the car-free area. The houses are planned in small groups around squares which makes it easy for neighbors to interact socially and to keep an eye on the children.

In the area there is a small center with a nice newly renovated grocery store with generous opening hours and a popular pizzeria. Here is also Krusboda school and two preschools as well as the Krusboda bath, the areas own pool facility.

From Krusboda is close proximity to several outdoor gyms and swimming lakes and Alby open-air farm with a beach bath, electric light trails and Uddby farm with a variety of animals.

There are very good bus connections by motorway bus to both Gullmarsplan and Stockholm Central.

Here, the Sörmlandsleden hiking trail also passes on the way to the nearby Tyresta National Park.
