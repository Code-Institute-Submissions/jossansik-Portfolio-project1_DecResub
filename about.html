            <p>
                Krusboda is scenically located high in a hilly forest terrain with a mile-wide view. for children, it is
                a kingdom
                of heaven with planned play areas right next to the buildings. Thanks to special garages and parking
                spaces at a convenient distance from the houses, you can enjoy the car-free area. The houses are planned
                in small groups around squares which makes it easy for neighbors to interact socially and to keep an eye
                on the children.
