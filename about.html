                The residential area of Krusboda
            </h1>
            <p>
                Krusboda is scenically located high in a hilly forest terrain with a mile-wide view. For children, it is a kingdom of heaven with many planned play areas right next to the buildings. Thanks to special garages and parking spaces at a convenient walking
                distance from the houses, residents can enjoy the car-free area. The houses are planned in small groups around squares which makes it easy for neighbors to interact socially and to keep an eye on the children.
            </p>

                From Krusboda is close proximity to several outdoor gyms and swimming lakes and Alby nature reserve with a beach bath, electric light trails and Uddby farm with a variety of animals. There are very good bus connections by motorway bus to both Gullmarsplan
                and Stockholm Central. Here, the Sörmlandsleden hiking trail also passes on the way to the nearby Tyresta National Park.
