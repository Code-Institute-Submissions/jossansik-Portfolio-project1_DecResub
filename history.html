                Krusboda - cultural-historical environment

                Krusboda was the name of a croft that lay along an important highway. It was built in the 17th century
                as a bell ringers house, a simple log cabin with kitchen and chamber. The bell ringer was the priest's
                right hand and was entitled to free housing. Several outbuildings belonged to the croft. Krusboda
                functioned as a bell ringers house until the 1740s when it became a day labor cottage under the Tyresö
                estate. The croft was dismantled in the 1970s.

                The new Krusboda was built in 1970–1975 as one of Sweden's largest group house areas with high social
                ambitions that were about facilitating meetings between people. When it was built, 1,500 homes were
                added in the form of terraced houses, atrium houses and detached villas. Krusboda became an alternative
                to the large high-rise buildings and was populated by young families with children, who could let the
                children run on the labyrinth-like pedestrian streets without risk. This planning has attracted families
                with children in recent years as well.

                From the beginning, the facades got a little different looks and different color schemes to create a
                small-scale environment around the small squares and playgrounds. After almost fifty years, the houses
                have acquired an increasingly individual character and now the question is discussed whether it can be
                valuable to preserve a strip of buildings that must not be changed; a cultural monument.
